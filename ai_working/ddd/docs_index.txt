# DDD Phase 2: Non-Code Files Index

## Files to Update (from plan.md)

[x] README.md - Add trends command to quick reference
[x] docs/USER_GUIDE.md - Document trends visualization feature
[x] docs/DESIGN.md - Add trends.py module to architecture

## Processing Notes

- Use retcon writing (feature already exists, present tense)
- Apply maximum DRY (no duplication)
- Check for context poisoning
- Mark [x] when complete
