## 🎤 Your Complete Presentation Story

### **Opening** (30 seconds)
"I built Companion - a production-ready AI security infrastructure using journaling as the demonstration use case."

### **Security** (2 minutes)
"6 defense-in-depth layers:
- Encryption with key rotation
- Encrypted audit logs with tamper detection
- Passphrase strength enforcement (NIST)
- Brute force protection
- PII detection

Plus: Designed memory security and model quantization."

### **Research** (2 minutes)
"AI security research:
- 96.6% on classic attacks
- 86.8% on 2024-2025 (FlipAttack, Unicode, Base64)
- **Research finding**: Regex has gaps, need semantic layer
- This is real R&D: test → measure → discover → iterate"

### **Demo** (1.5 minutes)
- Show real AI working
- Demonstrate security features
- Show 413 tests passing

### **Impact** (1 minute)
"This architecture applies to any AI with sensitive data:
- Security intelligence
- Healthcare
- Legal
- Enterprise

I'm ready to build this for PANW."
