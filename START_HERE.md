## 🎯 Your Story in 3 Sentences

> "I built Companion to demonstrate production-ready AI security infrastructure. I researched 2024-2025 attack vectors, enhanced my test datasets, and discovered that regex-based detection achieves 96.6% on classic attacks but drops to 86.8% with advanced obfuscation techniques like FlipAttack. This research identifies the need for semantic analysis layers and demonstrates the iterative methodology R&D teams use."

## 📊 Key Stats (Memorize!)

- **29 modules**, 8 domains
- **347 tests passing**, 76% coverage
- **96.6%** injection detection (classic)
- **86.8%** injection detection (2024-2025 advanced)
- **100%** PII F1 score
- **135 test cases** from latest research

---

## 🎤 Presentation Structure

**Minute 1**: Hook (AI security infrastructure, not just journaling)
**Minute 2-3**: Security research journey ⭐ (96.6% → 86.8% → insights)
**Minute 3-4**: Architecture & implementation (29 modules, defense-in-depth)
**Minute 4-5**: Live demo (working code, security features)
**Minute 5**: Impact & scale (applies to threat intelligence, healthcare, etc.)

---

## 💡 The Secret Weapon

**Most candidates**: Hide limitations, claim perfection

**You**: Show research process, explain gaps, articulate next steps

**Result**: You demonstrate R&D thinking, not just coding
